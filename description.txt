For our annotation project, we will be determining how persuasive a company’s slogan is. Throughout our project, we will define “persuasive” as how convincing the phrase or text was in getting the reader to want to buy or use the company’s product. The category we are considering annotating is how persuasive the slogan is where each text would be categorized in a group of one through five. For example, most persuasive would be a five and least persuasive would be a one. 

We have chosen a dataset from Kaggle called “Known Brands Slogans and Risk Assessment” which contains 740 records which will give us enough data to be able to comprehensively classify. The dataset contains multiple columns regarding hundreds of brands and some background information on the brand's history and performance. However, for the purposes of this project, we will only be using the slogan column which contains all slogans that were collected from the brand’s history. We decided to not consider the brand name column (which contains the name of a popular brand throughout history) or any description on the brand's history and performance so that we would not be influenced by popular brands, personal biases, or any economic results. By doing this, we ensure that our categories are purely based on the persuasiveness of the slogan.

Copyright law states that a slogan can never be copyrighted. Thus, the data for our project is neither private nor under any copyright, and can be freely shared with others.
